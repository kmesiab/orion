// ProcessPullRequest processes a given GitHub Pull Request URL and returns a combined
// string representation of all Git diffs in the pull request. This function is designed
// to be bound to a TypeScript function, enabling the frontend to interact with the
// GitHub API through this Go method.
//
// Parameters:
//   - url: A string representing the full URL of a GitHub pull request.
//
// Returns:
//   - A string containing the combined diffs of the pull request, or an error message
//     if the URL is invalid or if there's an error in fetching the pull request.
//
// The function first attempts to parse the provided URL using the GithubService. If the
// URL is invalid, it returns an error message. Then, it fetches the pull request data
// from GitHub and combines the diffs of each file in the pull request into a single
// string, which is then returned.
//
// If there's an error in fetching the pull request, an error message is returned.
// This function is particularly useful in applications that need to process or display
// the changes in a pull request, such as in code review tools or development dashboards.

	I've reviewed your recent pull request, and overall, the changes look great! I appreciate your efforts. However, I have a few suggestions for improvement:

	1. **Variable Naming:**
	   - Consider using more descriptive variable names to enhance code readability.

	2. **Comments:**
	   	- Add comments to explain complex logic or any non-trivial parts of the code.

	3. **Error Handling:**
 	  - Ensure proper error handling for critical sections of the code.

	4. **Code Duplication:**
 	  - Watch out for code duplication. It's always good to refactor common logic into reusable functions.

	5. **Testing:**
 	  - Don't forget to include test cases for the new functionality.

	Please address these points, and once done, feel free to merge the changes. Great job overall!`
